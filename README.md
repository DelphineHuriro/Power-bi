# Sales data analysis using Power BI
After taking Power BI course,I decided to put the knoweledge gained into action by doing this Auto sales analysis.
## ETL process
In this project I started with importing Xls file into power bi and clean it using Power query.I cleaned the dataset  by performing Data types change,removing duplicates,creating new columns etc) 
In this stage,I also divided the dataset into fact table and multiple dimensions tables such as customers with customer related attributes(Name,address,phone ,city etc),products with products related attribute such as products code,product line.
## Data modelling
In this stage,I started with establishing relationships between fact table and dimensions tables using Start Schema method and then created a Date table for later time intelligence calculations.
I also calculated measures to be used in visualization such as Average price,Sales YTD,Y0Y comparisons etc.
